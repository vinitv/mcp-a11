This project is a demonstration of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which utilizes the Tavily API for web search capabilities. The server is designed to run in a standard input/output (stdio) transport mode.

## Project Overview

The MCP server is set up to handle web search queries using the Tavily API. It is built with the following key components:

- **TavilyClient**: A client for interacting with the Tavily API to perform web searches.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- A valid Tavily API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and add your Tavily API key:
   ```
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the MCP Server

To start the MCP server, you will need to add the following to your MCP Profile in Cursor:

```
{
    "mcpServers":  {
        "websearch-server": {
            "command" : "uv",
            "args" : ["--directory", "/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY", "run", "server.py"]
        }
    }
}
```

The server will start and listen for commands via standard input/output.

## Usage

The server provides a `web_search` tool that can be used to search the web for information about a given query. This is achieved by calling the `web_search` function with the desired query string.
